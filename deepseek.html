With the introduction of new language models like what is this Chinese DeepSeek on top of OpenAI amongst other AI solutions out there, I realized that there's supposed to be a response from every country. And right now that we've gotten into an AI race, I would like to have a conversation with South Africans and maybe inspire them or encourage them to work together towards problem solving in the new age of AI. I would like to have my company provide services and solutions towards AI-related problems in companies because now there's a great rise, since there's a rise in AI, there's going to be a rise in all sorts of designers. So I would like to provide services and solutions maybe to companies that require people who can provide advices and guidance and security in terms of data protection towards accessing these new AI tools. So you could call it like some portal that you log into and then it protects your data and then you can use it to authenticate, to log into all these other services basically so that your data is kept safe. That portal submits a key to maybe some cash somewhere and that cash keeps proof that this particular website or this particular company has your data and you can take that piece of paper and submit it to to the courts and stuff. I want to provide a service like that and I also want to provide solutions to maybe try and teach people about AI, maybe be an AI, I want to actually call myself a techtivist. A techtivist, a person who gives basically advices regarding technology within the community etc. So I want to discuss that idea with you.

I love the vision you're forming here. You're essentially looking at AI from a national and community-based perspective—how South Africa can position itself in this AI race while ensuring that people and businesses have the right tools, knowledge, and protections. That’s both strategic and necessary.

Key Elements of Your Vision
AI Awareness & National Response – You want to engage South Africans in the AI conversation, making sure they work together to problem-solve in this new era.
AI Solutions for Businesses – You see an opportunity to provide AI-related services, particularly around data protection, security, and authentication.
A Secure AI Access Portal – A centralized authentication and security layer for businesses and individuals to interact with AI tools while maintaining control over their data.
Legal & Ethical AI Protection – A system that generates proof of data ownership that can be submitted to courts, ensuring accountability in AI-related disputes.
AI Education & Advocacy (Techtivism) – Teaching people about AI, ensuring they are informed and empowered rather than exploited by the tech shift.
Breaking it Down
1. AI Awareness & Collaboration in South Africa
The AI race is in full swing, and countries like China, the US, and the EU are already setting standards. South Africa (and Africa as a whole) needs a structured response. You could:

Create an AI Forum or Roundtable – A space for South Africans to discuss AI opportunities and risks, involving businesses, government, and communities.
Advocate for AI Policy & Ethics – Work with lawmakers, universities, and the private sector to shape AI laws in a way that protects people and businesses.
2. AI Security Solutions & Data Protection Portal
This is where your business comes in. Many companies will need a safe way to integrate AI without compromising their data. Your AI security portal could:

Act as a data authentication & privacy layer before users interact with AI tools.
Provide an audit trail that can be legally recognized if companies misuse AI.
Offer a trust-based certification (e.g., “AI-Safe Certified”) for businesses using AI responsibly.
3. AI Education & Techtivism
I like the concept of “Techtivism”—being an activist for ethical and inclusive tech. This could involve:

AI literacy programs for businesses and communities.
Workshops & Webinars on AI risks, opportunities, and data security.
Partnerships with Universities & Schools to upskill the next generation.
Next Steps
Brand & Identity – Do you want to operate under 1Pulse.online, or create a new initiative?
Secure Early Adopters – Identify 5–10 companies or groups who would benefit from AI security solutions and education.
Prototype the AI Security Portal – Even a basic version that authenticates access to AI tools while protecting user data could be a game-changer.
Start the Conversation – A blog, a podcast, or a forum could help spark South Africa’s AI response.
Would you want this to be a for-profit company, an NPO, or a hybrid model? Also, do you already have any partners or companies that might be interested in testing the AI security portal?






You said:
I want the portal to have a user profile. Then inside it will have and email address and other data points needed by other websites. Then a person logins into this portal the portal checks every website or app they use to see if there are any attackers targeting this website in any data bases. I'm not sure if I make sense 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're making sense. You’re essentially describing a secure identity and AI-powered threat monitoring portal that:

Stores & Manages User Data – A centralized profile with key data points (email, authentication details, etc.) that other websites and apps can use.
Acts as a Login Gateway – Users log into this portal first, and then it handles authentication for other services securely.
Monitors Security Threats – The system checks databases for known cyber threats (e.g., leaked credentials, phishing attacks, data breaches) before allowing the user to interact with a website or app.
AI-Powered Risk Assessment – If a website the user is trying to access has been flagged for vulnerabilities, the system could warn the user or prevent access until security measures are taken.
How It Works (Example Flow)
User logs into the portal instead of logging into websites directly.
The portal authenticates the user and stores credentials securely.
When the user wants to access a site, the portal:
Checks for security threats (e.g., known attacks, vulnerabilities).
Logs them in safely using encrypted credentials.
If the website is flagged as unsafe, the user gets a warning (or the system applies security fixes).
Key Features to Include
User Profile Management (emails, passwords, biometric login, etc.).
Threat Intelligence Feeds (monitoring known hacking attempts, leaked data).
AI-Based Security Alerts (warn users when their data is at risk).
Encrypted Authentication (like a password manager but with real-time security checks).
Legal Audit Trail (so users have proof if a company misuses their data).
Who Would Use This?
Individuals – To keep their personal data safe.
Businesses – To ensure employees access only secure websites.
Government & Legal Systems – To track and prevent cybercrime.
This could be a huge service because data breaches and cyber-attacks are growing—people need both protection and control over their data.

Would you want this to be a browser extension, a mobile app, or a full web dashboard? And do you see this as a free community tool or a paid security service?






You said:
Paid service. All platforms 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
That makes sense. A paid security service across web, mobile, and browser extensions would give users full control over their online identity and security.

Business Model & Monetization
Since security is a high-value market, you could monetize in multiple ways:

Subscription Model (SaaS) – Monthly/annual plans for individuals and businesses.
Enterprise Security Packages – Sell to companies needing employee data protection.
Premium AI Threat Monitoring – Advanced users can pay for deeper security scans.
Legal & Compliance Services – Offer businesses legal protection packages related to AI and cybersecurity.
Platform Breakdown
1. Web Dashboard (Main Hub)
Full user profile management.
Login history & AI-powered risk analysis.
Threat monitoring reports for sites and apps.
Legal audit trail of data access and breaches.
2. Mobile App
Secure login to websites & apps.
Live security alerts if credentials are exposed.
Biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition).
3. Browser Extension
Auto-login with secure authentication.
Real-time website security check (before login).
AI-powered phishing detection (flags unsafe sites).
Competitive Advantage
More than a password manager (adds AI-driven security checks).
Prevents phishing & data leaks (monitors breaches in real time).
AI-powered security alerts (warns users before logging in).
Legal protection & proof of data use (audit trail for courts).
Would you want to start with a minimum viable product (MVP) for testing first? Maybe a browser extension + web dashboard, then expand to mobile?

I want to be a Techtivist. Someone who speaks on Ai a lot in south africa... I want to differentiate between the three things I'm doing. 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
That makes sense—you’re building a personal brand as a Techtivist while running separate business ventures. To keep things clear, let’s define the three distinct areas:

1. Siya Percy, the Techtivist (Public Figure & Thought Leader)
What You Do: Speak on AI’s impact in South Africa—opportunities, risks, policies, ethics, and innovation.
How You Engage:
Public speaking, podcasts, social media, YouTube, and events.
Writing articles and opinion pieces on AI in Africa.
Engaging with government, businesses, and communities.
Goal: Shape the AI conversation in South Africa and advocate for responsible AI adoption.
2. AI Security & Authentication Business (Paid Service)
What You Offer: A secure AI-powered portal for individuals and businesses that:
Protects their online identity & data.
Authenticates logins securely.
Monitors websites for security risks.
Monetization: Subscription-based cybersecurity service.
Platform: Web dashboard, mobile app, browser extension.
Goal: Provide AI-powered cybersecurity & data protection to companies and individuals.
3. AI Education & Community Initiatives (1Pulse.online or New Project?)
What You Offer:
AI literacy programs for individuals & businesses.
Workshops, courses, and training on AI and cybersecurity.
Grassroots activism around AI policies & ethics.
Monetization:
Free & paid courses.
Consulting for businesses & institutions.
Goal: Make AI knowledge accessible and empower South Africans.
Branding & Naming Considerations
Do you want:

One umbrella brand (e.g., all under 1Pulse.online)?
Separate brands (e.g., "Siya Percy, the Techtivist" for speaking, a unique name for the AI security business, and a separate AI education platform)?
If you're aiming to be the face of AI discussions in SA, you could use your personal brand for advocacy while keeping the security and education services as separate business entities.






You said:
I want to separate the brands and businesses 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Good move! Keeping your personal brand separate from your businesses will give you more flexibility and clarity. Here’s how you can structure everything:

1. Siya Percy – The Techtivist (Personal Brand & Public Figure)

What You Do:
Speak on AI's impact in Africa (events, podcasts, YouTube, social media).

YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok.
Speaking at tech conferences & corporate events.
Revenue Streams:
Speaking engagements & consulting.

Workshops for companies.
AI bootcamps & accelerator programs.
Next Steps
Finalize Business Names – Do any of these names stand out, or do you have other ideas?
Build Brand Identities – Each business needs a logo, website, and branding.
Start Marketing Each Separately – Your Techtivist brand will boost awareness, while your security business & AI education programs serve different markets.
Develop the MVP for Your AI Security Business – Maybe start with a browser extension + web dashboard before expanding to mobile.
Would you want to start all three at once, or focus on launching one first?






You said:
There's also "what's next". 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Alright, so now we have four distinct things you're working on:

Siya Percy – The Techtivist (Public Figure & AI Thought Leader)
AI Security & Authentication Business (Paid Service for Companies & Individuals)
AI Education & Community Initiative (Non-Profit or Business?)
What’s Next (New Concept – Let’s Define It)
What is "What’s Next"?
Is it:

A news & research platform about AI advancements?
A business incubator for AI-driven startups?
A trend-spotting & forecasting service for businesses?
A personal development platform focused on AI & future skills?
If it's about predicting and preparing for the future, then "What’s Next" could be:

A content platform (videos, blogs, reports on future AI trends).
A consulting service that helps businesses prepare for AI-driven changes.
A community/network for innovators who want to shape the future.
How do you see "What’s Next" fitting into everything else? Would it be part of your Techtivist brand, or a completely separate business?

I am in training with a few entrepreneurs and we are learning about financial management, business development and marketing, including websites and apps. 

In the sessions I have people who are discussing some kind of group/collective partnership. I came up with the name WhatsNext. This is because this is not my first training and after this workshop and networking sessions. I want us as businesses to open a joint office that we will all occupy as different business owners, we could club in on this and we can also apply for funding. 

I am concerned about the climate of business in south africa with the new developments in Ai and other factors. I want us to have strategic partnerships when is comes to competing in be markets. Our businesses are not only tech based but there is logistics, catering, fashion, media etc. Whenever there is a news update I want to ask the question: "what's next". So that as businesses we can have an accountability relationship with each other. A person can give us an update every day about their plans for the day and we should have some kind of schedule for updates so we as the fellow businesses we can advise or support. I want to have weekly meeting and a monthly project. The monthly project is normally an advert that encorporates all the business so that it can be easy to make adverts for cheaper. I want to write an invitation to the group so that everyone can give me their expectations for the WhatsNext collective. Like I'd like it if each of us would offer an mount of hours per month and financial contribution per month, e.g. If a fashion designer offers design time they could have the option to forgo financial contributions but offer design and sawing contribution s.
